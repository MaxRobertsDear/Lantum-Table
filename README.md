 Lantum's joyful data table provides Locum's easy access to the appropriate and available job postings in their area.

## 🤔 Assumptions
1. Users will likely be viewing the app on their phone. Therefore mobile-first design is the approach taken.
2. Pagination for improved UX (faster loading and easier navigation) - assume 10 rows per page.
3. Filtering options for improved UX (easier to find the relevant data) - reach goal.
4. Data will be ordered by data, by default.
5. For the purposes of this task, I am assuming that the user is already logged in.
